# TrustIn
A Blockchain Based Crowd Funding Platform
Made with flutter and smart Contracts.

## Idea
We want to make a decentralized system where no authority is involved using Blockchain technology.
So we came up with TrustIn, a platform which allows users to raise funds for purchasing products for their personal and professional needs.

Our app benefits both the investor as well as the fund raiser.
The fund raiser is able to buy the product now and pay the investor later. 
The investor benefits by earning interest on his investments.

## What we solve
In all the existing crowdfunding platforms, both the investor as well as the fund raiser have to trust a third party (the platform) to handle their money correctly.
But in our approach all funds are transferred directly from the investor to the fund raiser through smart contracts (using blockchain) and no third party is involved.

## Example

Suppose Abhimanyu, a college student, wishes to raise money for buying a MacBook for his educational needs.
Mr. Gupta can choose to help him by paying 50% of the cost, at 3% interest per month. This helps Abhimanyu to complete the payment now, and repay Mr. Gupta later. 

In this way, we aim to help many users raise funds for their
needs, get credit easily, and achieve their dreams! 
Also we help investor to earn interest on his investment.

Itâ€™s a win-win and secure situation for both parties.

## How it works
We used solidity to write smart cotracts which was deployed to a test etherum network (Rinkbey).
To communicate to our contracts deployed on blockchain network from flutter we use web3dart library which connect to an Ethereum node with the rpc-api, call common methods etc.

All transactions are carried out securely using Ethereum Blockchain.
